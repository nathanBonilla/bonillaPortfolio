##  Aspiring Developer!

###  Work in progress Developer Portfolio!

https://bonillaproject.com is a showcase of my journey about becoming a developer!
By taking my past experiences as a System Administrator and combining it with my aspirations of Full Stack Development, I want to push my limits and make something I can be proud of.
Everything about this website has been built from the ground up.  AWS server, load balancing, SSL certificates, and more to come!  I will be implementing everything from scratch in my attempt to make something wonderful.  The Bonilla Project!
